# Presentation GGJ

A `Game jam` is a tournament in which everyone can participate alone or in team to create a game in a certain amount of time, most of the time from scratch.
At the end of the jam, each game is posted on the jam website and everyone can try, grade and give some feedbacks about each game.

The `Global Game Jam` is one of the biggest and most famous game jam around the world. Last year, it hosted teams in more than 850 sites in 113 countries and generated 9000 games in one weekend.

# Organisation 

Nono's team, a team of four motivated students.
