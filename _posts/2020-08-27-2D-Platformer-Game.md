# Presentation

`Les aventures de Tartine` is a 2D platformer game developped using Unity by Valentin Rapine, Corentin Aubrun and myself during the lockdown of 2020.

You are Tartine. You start the game in a cave and your goal is to reach the surface, avoiding the dangers you can find underground like monsters, gap or lava.

You can recover after your injuries with hearts and gain money with coins. The difficulty increases with levels, but there are many hidden path...

We had precise tasks during this project. Valentin made the animations, Corentin the game design and playability, and i made, using C#, all the interactions between the player and the environment.
